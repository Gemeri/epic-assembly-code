## epic-assembly-code
**Super epic scripts coded in assembly. More to come!**

All programed using ml64 on visual studio with windows. Gotta have MASM installed and kernel32

or just run the already compiled executable

## greet_user.asm

Are you bored sad and lonely? Is the only way to cure that loneliness being greeted by an assembly script? Well look no further! greet_user.asm will not only ask for your name, but greet you to!!!

assemble script:

```
ml64 /c /Fo greet_user.obj greet_user.asm
```

Create exe:

```
link /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE /OUT:greet_user.exe greet_user.obj kernel32.lib /ENTRY:main
```

Run exe:
```
./greet_user
```

## hello.asm

Good ol' classic "Hello World" but in assembly

assemble script:

ml64 /c hello.asm
```

```
link /subsystem:console /defaultlib:ucrt.lib /defaultlib:vcruntime.lib /defaultlib:legacy_stdio_definitions.lib /entry:main hello.obj
```

```
ml64 /c /Zi word_uzzer.asm
```

Create exe:

```
link /ENTRY:main /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE /OUT:word_uzzer.exe word_uzzer.obj kernel32.lib
